##CDP

CDP is the short name for Chef De Piste. On a normal gliding day, this person is in charge 
of the electronic registration of the take-off and landings of all the gliders. 

The current system in use still works very good, however, it is in need of some modifications. 
First we will try to describe what the system must be capable of.
