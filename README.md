##CDP

CDP is the short name for Chef De Piste. On a normal gliding day, this person is in charge 
of the electronic registration of the take-off and landings of all the gliders. 

The current system in use still works very good, however, it is in need of some modifications. 
First we will try to describe what the system must be capable of.


#features (of the actual system)

* register a glider flight

  * glider immatriculation
  * pilot('s) names
  * takeoff/landing times
  * type of flight
  * handling of tickets
 
* prevent the user from making mistakes

  * check of take-off and landing times
  * 
* work offline (data connection in the field is not good)
* look like the old system, less training needed
* upload all data to the website (SOAP interface)
 

#new requirements (new system)

1. type of flight according to ATO specs 
2. check if a pilot is green (ok to fly, fly solo, fly with passengers, etc)
3. check if a glider is green (arc ok, insurance ok, ...)
4. extra checks for ticketing system?
